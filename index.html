  hello. i’m neol.<br>
  seventeen.<br>
  not in college yet.<br>
  just trying to move different while most people are still asleep to the bigger picture.<br><br>

  i’m working on my body<br>
  not for looks<br>
  but because it sharpens me<br>
  keeps my mind from drifting<br>
  makes the mirror feel honest<br><br>

  my days are mostly quiet<br>
  some people think that’s a mystery thing<br>
  it’s not<br>
  i just don’t like saying things that don’t matter<br><br>

  i’m building something<br>
  not rushing it<br>
  but it’s there<br>
  in the background, moving<br>
  one decision at a time<br><br>

  she’s in the picture too<br>
  not loud, not public<br>
  but steady<br>
  she gets the version of me no one else really earns<br><br>

  some things i stand by:<br>
  – stop explaining yourself<br>
  – the right people already get it<br>
  – don’t chase aesthetics. become undeniable through consistency<br>
  – you don’t need more clothes. or more opinions. or more noise<br>
  – clarity comes in silence<br><br>

  this year’s about refining<br>
  cutting the excess<br>
  thinking sharper<br>
  moving smarter<br><br>
